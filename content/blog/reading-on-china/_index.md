Understanding China (whatever that means) seems to me to be one of the most important things I can do as a young tech-y-politics-y person right now. I certainly am nowhere near that. This is a list of books I've been reading (for the biographies, sometimes audiobooks as well) on China specifically. Some unstructured thoughts and notes on each below. 

**Jacques Gernet - A History of Chinese Civilization (2nd edition)**

My first foray (mostly during early covid lockdowns), and probably not the best way to start. Very dense, and not really meant to be read cover-to-cover, especially by someone without a good understanding of Chinese geography (which I have gotten much better at since), or much context on pre-Ming Chinese history (still meh). The different romanization (TODO) made it even harder for me to link concepts up in my mind. Still, it was good as a context pump for almost everything else I read afterwards, and I will go back some day and hope to get much more out of it. I did not finish it, but reviews say that it gets much weaker in the last chapters, especially regarding Mao. Fortunately, most of the other books I have bought cover exactly those areas. 

At some point I would really like to understand how chariot warfare worked in ancient civilizations. They seem to have been extremely important in Egypt and Mesopotamia, and Ancient China, yet my Thuringian brain can't really comprehend how they could ever be useful, and why they did not constantly get stuck, break down in the woods, get encircled, and so on (why can't you just kill the horses? you have spears!). It might be relevant that I have never visited any of these places. In general, I found the chapters on the gradual buildup of states and cities, and the constant noble warfare, interesting in the abstract, but have not really developed an intuition for how it actually worked, neither the political nor the military side. 


**Ezra F. Vogel - Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China**

Came into this hoping for something like Caro's treatment of Moses, both regarding the shifting political economies that Deng was working in, and the personal drives behind such an extraordinary mind. That is... not what this book is about. But it's still very interesting, even if it lacks color.

The most striking realization, especially in the midst of Vogel's very dry delivery, is how *incredibly* self-controlled Deng was, in the midst of constant threat for himself, anyone close to him, and with constantly shifting goalposts and no guarantee of anything. He lived a life without ever subordinating his career chances and odds of political survival to his personal emotions, even they conflicted with the life and health of his family, his personal freedom, ideological coherence, or honor. He really was the ultimate grindset guy, on a level no twitter e/acc could comprehend. Unfortunately, you don't really get a sense of knowing what moved him from Vogel; the chapters up until his ascent after Maos death fly by with the biographical details, but it really feels like reading about an alien creature. Deng did not write down *anything*, and I got a new appreciation for the western tradition of record keeping and opening up of stored records, interviews, memoirs, and hagiographies, that at least create a paper trail for later works. 


**Dan Wang - Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future**

I credit Dan with initially sparking my interest in China at all, especially the economic development and futuristic spirit, and being the most interesting author I had read up to that point (before I found the rat-adjacent blogosphere, though Dan's annual letters are still up there with the best of them). Back during my Physics undergrad, he showed me that you could actually be a guy that is deeply interested in and knowledgeable about history, technical subjects, and music (plus his food obsession, which I sadly cannot match), and has been a role model ever since (damn, this sounds so parasocial writing it). I was very frustrated that most of his output back then was hidden behind the Gavekal Dragonomics paywalls, and could not be more pleased with how much more public-facing he has become since. Of course, everyone and their mothers has swallowed his worldview whole ("total Dan Wang victory", as Joe Weisenthal put it), but I feel like he gave me a solid five years of head start in understanding what China is actually able to do, and how incredibly unprepared and unserious my own country is in meeting that challenge.



Honorable Mention: The **Three-Body-Problem trilogy by Liu Cixin**. Not really *about* China (though not not about China either). Self-recommending, and the Cultural Revolution scenes were exactly as horrifying as they were supposed to be. It seems like many important CCP leaders had origin stories almost as horrifying as Ye Wenjie (c.f. Deng's favorite son getting paralysed after being thrown out of a window by Red Guards), yet stayed loyal to the system and even perpetuated it. Why did Ye Wenjie lose her faith in humanity (and of course, in Communism and the Party), and they did not? I fundamentally do not understand the mental life of people experiencing all of the willful catastrophies inflicted by the CCP on its own people, and then choosing to support and uphold that system. But I really should, given that they will soon rule... much more.

On the list:
- Jonathan Chatwin - The Southern Tour: Deng Xiaoping and the Fight for China's Future
- Jin Qiu - The Culture of Power
