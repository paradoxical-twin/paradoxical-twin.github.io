SF Tech culture *really* likes to talk about "building". Of course, they (usually) don't really mean it in the dirty, real-world sense with construction tools, only in the laptop-based way, but you don't work *on* something, you *build* something. The term has a serious issue of the most annoying or destructive people overusing it, but overall I like the framing a lot, and would wish more of it on this side of the pond. It brings to mind an image of something sturdy, lasting, solid. 

It also seems uniquely ill-suited to the current moment, especially in anything related to software. In a world where noobs like me can hack together functioning applications, and more-qualified people can rapidly prototype amazing features that would previously have been months-long efforts, the value of an individual piece of software is a lot more variable. There are many moats for tech companies left, but one of the most significant - the physical time of somebody that can code well - is gone.
