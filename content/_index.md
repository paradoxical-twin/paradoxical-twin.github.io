        I am working on scaling the reach of Quantum Communication to intercontinental distances. This includes running free-space link experiments on our in-house, adaptive-optics enhanced 1.7 km link, building ultrabright entangled pair sources, high-performance analysis equipment, or simulation tools for satellite-based QC. 

        I also spend an obsessive amount of time on current AI developments, and try to incorporate them into our research. 

        Please reach out if you want to run experiments with us on the link, want to run combined experiments in some other capacity, or just want to chat about QC and AI/ML.
