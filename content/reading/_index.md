        A list of books I've been enjoying or at least found valuable over the recent years, with comments sometimes. In no particular order.
        
        **The Years of Lyndon Johnson, Books 1-4** by Robert A. Caro  
        Just amazing. I distrust how poetic some of the characterizations feel, but I can't wait for the last book.
        
        **The Power Broker** by Robert A. Caro
        
        **One Hundred Years of Solitude** by Gabriel Garcia Marquez
        
        **Anna Karenina** by Lev Tolstoy
        
        **Grand Strategies** by Charles Hill
        
        **Lost in Math** by Sabine Hossenfelder
        
        **The Stormlight Archive, Books 1-5** by Brandon Sanderson
        
        **The Bible**
        
        **The Three-Body Problem** by Cixin Liu  
        As great as everybody says it is.
        
        **The Dark Forest** and **Death's End** by Cixin Liu
        
        **Moral Mazes** by Robert Jackall
        
        **Dear Reader** by Michael Malice
        
        **Letters to a Young Contrarian** by Christopher Hitchens
        
        **Collapse** by Valdislav M. Zubok
        
        **Seeing Like a State** by James C. Scott
        
        **A Fire Upon The Deep** by Vernor Vinge
        
        **Thinking, Fast and Slow** by Daniel Kahneman
        
        **Gödel, Escher, Bach** by Douglas Hofstadter  
        Did not finish it first time reading it. Meaning to go back to it for ages now, with what we learned since the Transformer. One day.
        
        **1984** by George Orwell
        
        **A History of Chinese Civilization** by Jacques Gernet  
        A bit too dense for what I would have needed at that point. I am still looking for books to get a better grip on ancient and imperial China.
        
        **Unsong** by Scott Alexander
