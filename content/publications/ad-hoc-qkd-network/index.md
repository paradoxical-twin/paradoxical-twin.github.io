abstract: This paper presents the development and implementation of a versatile ad-hoc metropolitan-range quantum key distribution (QKD) network. The approach presented integrates various types of physical channels and QKD protocols, and a mix of trusted nodes and intermodal coupling. Unlike conventional QKD networks that predominantly depend on either fiber-based or free-space optical (FSO) links, the testbed presented incorporates FSO and fiber-based links, thereby overcoming some inherent limitations. Various network deployment strategies have been considered, including permanent infrastructure and provisional ad-hoc links to eradicate coverage gaps. Furthermore, the ability to rapidly establish a network using portable FSO terminals and to investigate diverse link topologies is demonstrated. The study also showcases the successful establishment of a quantum-secured link to a cloud server.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present a versatile ad-hoc metropolitan-range quantum key distribution network integrating FSO and fiber-based links, demonstrating rapid network deployment with portable terminals and quantum-secured cloud connectivity.
